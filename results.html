        Well done! Achieving a medium score is a commendable accomplishment. It
        demonstrates a solid understanding of the material and a successful
        application of knowledge. However, remember that everyone has strengths
        and areas of improvement. Use this as an opportunity to identify where
        you excel and where you could enhance. Don't let this achievement
        discourage you from striving for excellence in future quizzes. Keep
        learning, keep practicing, and continue to grow.
